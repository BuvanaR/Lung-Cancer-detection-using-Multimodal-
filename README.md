# Lung Cancer Detection using Multi-Modal

Detecting lung cancer at an early stage—when the tumor is still small and localized—significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. Lung cancer screening is especially important for high-risk individuals, such as those with a history of smoking, even if they do not currently show any symptoms. Early detection in asymptomatic individuals opens the door to more effective and less invasive treatment options.

Lung Cancer Detection using Multi-Modal Machine Learning is a project focused on developing an intelligent diagnostic system that combines deep learning and multi-omics data analysis. The system integrates medical imaging data (CT scans) and biological data (e.g., genomic, transcriptomic features) to improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection. Advanced algorithms from both computer vision and machine learning are used to build a comprehensive, data-driven diagnostic approach.

The CT scan images are analyzed using a ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which automatically extracts high-level features indicative of tumor presence. In parallel, multi-omic data is processed using XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to uncover hidden patterns in biological markers. The outputs from both models are then fused to produce a final prediction, assisting healthcare professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses by leveraging complementary data sources.
